# Chengdu Rust Meetup Code of Conduct

At Chengdu Rust Meetup, we are committed to fostering an inclusive, safe, and welcoming environment for all attendees, irrespective of their nationality, race, gender, age, or background. To ensure a positive and respectful experience for everyone, we have established the following code of conduct.

## Respect for All:
- Treat all participants with respect and consideration, recognizing the diverse experiences and perspectives they bring to our community.
- Refrain from engaging in discriminatory behavior, which includes, but is not limited to, discrimination based on nationality, race, gender, age, and any other personal attributes.

## Inclusivity:
- Extend a warm welcome to attendees from all around the world, celebrating the richness of diverse cultures and backgrounds.
- Encourage the participation of individuals at varying skill levels, from beginners to experts, to create a learning and growth-friendly environment.

## Sensitivity to Political Matters:
- Acknowledge that political discussions, especially those related to sensitive or controversial topics, may not be appropriate for this community. We kindly request that attendees abstain from discussing such matters during our meetups.

## Reporting and Accountability:
- If you witness or experience any behavior that violates this code of conduct, please promptly report it to the event organizers or staff.
- All reports will be handled confidentially and with the utmost seriousness, and any necessary action will be taken to address the issue.

## Unacceptable Behavior:
The following behaviors are considered unacceptable and will not be tolerated:
- Harassment, discrimination, or any form of intimidation.
- Offensive comments or language.
- Personal attacks, whether in digital or physical form.
- Disruptive or disrespectful behavior during presentations or discussions.
- Any other conduct that infringes upon the sense of safety and inclusion of others.

## Consequences:
Attendees who engage in unacceptable behavior will be requested to cease such behavior. In severe cases, attendees may be removed from the event.

## Event Costs:
Rust Meetups do not charge an entry fee. These are community events, and all costs are the responsibility of individual attendees, including those incurred with the host venue. No funds are exchanged between attendees and the organizers, and the organizers do not receive any funds from the venue for hosting the event. If you ever encounter a situation that contradicts this, please report the incident to the meetup organizers.

## Attendee Expectations:
Attendees at our community meetups are expected to treat others with respect. If they are representing an organization or entity, discussions about their organization should only extend as far as others are willing to listen. Attendees are not permitted to sell products or services during the events.

### Networking and Recruitment:
Attendees are encouraged to network with other Rust developers, programmers, or professionals of any sort attending the meetups. However, individual privacy and boundaries must be respected. No attendee may pressure another to share contact information, etc. All recruitment activities should take place after the event has concluded.

### Non-Rust Related Discussion and Content:
To the best of your ability, we expect all attendees to respect the primary purpose of the meetup. Unless all attendees involved are comfortable delving into a non-Rust related topic, attendees are requested to respect the Rust-related nature of the meetups and stay on topic.

## Contact Information:
If you need to report an incident or have any questions related to this code of conduct, please contact our event organizers or staff.

## Acknowledgment:
By participating in Chengdu Rust Meetup, you acknowledge that you have read and agree to abide by this code of conduct.

We value your cooperation in creating a welcoming and respectful environment for all Rust enthusiasts. Together, we can learn, grow, and share our passion for Rust in an inclusive and harmonious community.
