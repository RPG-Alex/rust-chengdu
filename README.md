## About Rust

Rust is a modern system programming language focused on performance, safety, and concurrency. It accomplishes these goals by having a number of compile-time safety checks with no runtime overhead, while eliminating common bugs such as null pointer dereferencing, double free, dangling pointers, etc.

## Running the Code
1) Navigate to the project you wish to run
2) Ensure Rust and Cargo are installed and run:
   `cargo run`
