# Rust Introduction Tutorial

Welcome to the Rust Introduction Tutorial! This workshop is designed for those who are new to Rust, and it will walk you through the basics of using and understanding the language.

## About Rust

Rust is a modern system programming language focused on performance, safety, and concurrency. It accomplishes these goals by having a number of compile-time safety checks with no runtime overhead, while eliminating common bugs such as null pointer dereferencing, double free, dangling pointers, etc.

## Pre-requisites

To get the most out of this tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of programming concepts. Experience with a systems programming language like C or C++ can be helpful, but it's not a requirement.

You'll need the following software installed:

1. [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. An editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (recommended with the [Rust (rls)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust) extension)

## What You'll Learn

In this tutorial, you'll learn the basics of Rust, including:

- Variables and Data Types
- Control Flow
- Error Handling
- Ownership and Borrowing
- Structs, Enums, and Pattern Matching
- Modules, Packages, and Crates
- Concurrency

We'll also explore how to use the Cargo package manager to manage dependencies and build a Rust project.

## Running the Code

This project is a standard Cargo project. You can run the project with `cargo run`, test it with `cargo test`, and build it with `cargo build`.
