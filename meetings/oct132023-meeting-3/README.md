## About Rust

Rust is a modern system programming language focused on performance, safety, and concurrency. It accomplishes these goals by having a number of compile-time safety checks with no runtime overhead, while eliminating common bugs such as null pointer dereferencing, double free, dangling pointers, etc.

## Meeting Agenda:
- Projects with Rust: Backends, Desktop Applications, Games, more! (resources etc)
- Networking with other Developers - lets grow our community!
- Where to start with rust? - discussion and suggestions
